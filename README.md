This repository is forked from the Complexity Features repository by Sowmya Vajjala Balakrishna. It is extended to provide the linguistic features
used in the paper "Linguistic Features for Readability Sssessment" (Deutsch, Jasbi, and Shieber 2020). The original readme from Sowmya Vajjala Balakrishna
is provided below.

	This project contains code to extract some features related to linguistic complexity of English texts. This project contains a cleaner version of the code for various parts of my PhD thesis and attempts to integrate code written by some others from SfS (Department of Linguistics, University of Tuebingen) on related issues. More on this in the about/ABOUT.txt
